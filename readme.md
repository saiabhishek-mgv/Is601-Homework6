## Homework 6 

I have used the previous repository from prvious homework as the main branch.
Setup githubworkfloe files to run the tests on github actions.
Refactored the code to add environment variables in the env file and added logging as explained by professor.
Added .env in gitignore so that it does not get into the github repo preventing from sharing sensitive information which could leads to account ban.

### Installation and Testing
1. Clone the repo
2. Install and activate virtual environment
3. Install the requirements
4. pytest
5. python main.py
6. Click menu to look at the commands available
7. Example command: add 1 2
